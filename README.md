# crop-o-sphere
Project for the GottaGoHack Hackathon, 42 hours of hack ! 

Crop'O Shere is minimalistic looking game, where you are driving a tractor, on a small 3D planet.   
When near your farm, by spending some money, you can create fields that will bring you a passive income of ressources,   
Will will then need to sell those Ressources according to the food demand of different cities.   
Every cycles (3 in-game days), the demand and city population is updated, forcing you to keep track of the demand of every city.

If you succeed to complete most of the demands of a given city, its population will increase by a proportionnal amount,   
if not, the population will decrease and one day become empty (You lost the game).

There are 4 food ressources: Wheat, Potatoes, Apples and Cow meat
Note: Cow meat require a passive production of Wheat to be placed, that means: you need at least one wheat field to place a cow pens.
